# Mercato â€” Online Marketplace (UZ/RU)

This project mirrors the **Final-project** structure but is a fresh implementation:
- Apps under `apps/` (`accounts`, `catalog`, `orders`)
- Config with split settings (`config/settings/{base,development,production}.py`)
- Swagger docs (`/swagger/`), Token Auth, CORS, Permissions
- Tests with 80%+ coverage target
